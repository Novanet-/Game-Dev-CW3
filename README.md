<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Expo_3:_Innovative_Games"> Expo 3: Innovative Games </span></h1>
<p>Deadline: 1100 on Friday 19th May, 2017
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="General_Instructions">General Instructions</span></h2>
<p>This is the third of three courseworks where you will need to work in a pair to develop a game prototype (note â€“ NOT a complete game) using the Unity game engine and development tools.  You are required to work in a different pair for each coursework. 
</p><p>Your submission will be assessed in 2 parts: 
</p>
<ul><li> Expo (20%) - In the week of submission there will be a game Expo held in the normal lab slot. You will be presenting your games on the lab machines and have an opportunity to show each other what you have created. During this session assessors will visit each game and you will need to give a short demonstration of the game (3 mins approx.) and then answer some questions on your design choices. These will be taken from the list of questions specified in the Brief.
</li></ul>
<p><b>Expo attendance is compulsory - it is part of your assessment. Contact the module leader if you have a good reason for not being able to attend.</b>
</p>
<ul><li> Let's Play (80%) - Following the Expo the assessors will meet to play your game in more depth and assign a final mark. The assessment will consider the development quality of your submission, and two specific aspects based on the brief. These sessions will be recorded as feedback, and released as a Let's Play video on YouTube. The videos will not include a discussion of marks, these will be released to your team privately via email.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Brief_for_Expo_3">Brief for Expo 3</span></h2>
<p>Develop a game prototype that contains at least one of the following innovations:
</p>
<ul><li> adaptive difficulty - you <b>must</b> indicate to the player something that reflects the current level of difficulty
</li><li> procedural generation of content
</li><li> use of a novel game interface (controller and/or display - e.g. VR)
</li><li> real-world location-based elements 
</li></ul>
<p>Please note that you must be able to demonstrate your game in the Expo, so if you require special hardware it is your responsibility to make that available during the Expo; if your game is location-based you should include a mechanism that allows it to be played during the Expo (for example, by faking locations).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Potential_questions_for_the_Expo_Interview"> Potential questions for the Expo Interview </span></h3>
<ul><li> How does your chosen innovation enhance user experience or gameplay (and thus avoid being a gimmick)
</li><li> How has this innovation increased or decreased your overhead as developers?
</li></ul>
<p>Specific questions depending on the type of innovation you have chosen:
</p>
<ul><li> [adaptive difficulty] What data are recorded by your adaptive engine and how are they used to influence a change in the game play difficulty?
</li><li> [adaptive difficulty] In your adaptive system, what is the relationship between the skill of the player and the required difficulty of the game (e.g. linear, exponential, stereotyped) and how did you go about balancing that relationship?
</li></ul>
<ul><li> [procedural generation] What part of your game's content is procedurally generated and what algorithm (or otherwise) did you use?
</li><li> [procedural generation] Is your procedural content generated online or offline and does it use random seeds or user-set seeds or adapt based on the game state? Explain why you made these choices.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> [novel interface] How did you change your information design and feedback to take account of the interface?
</li><li> [novel interface] Did the interface have any impact on the mechanics/dynamics of your game?
</li></ul>
<ul><li> [location-based] How does the physical world context impact the experience of the virtual world of your game?
</li><li> [location-based] How have you defined location in your game, and how does location or changes of location translate into game mechanics?
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Criteria_for_Let.27s_Play"> Criteria for Let's Play </span></h3>
<p>Your game will be judged on three equally weighted criteria: 
</p>
<ul><li> Quality 
<ul><li> Does the submission fulfil the brief?
</li><li> Are there any bugs?
</li><li> Does the game control smoothly?
</li><li> Do the mechanics work well?
</li><li> Is the game well presented
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Effectiveness of implementation. E.g:
<ul><li> adaptive difficulty should perceptively impact play
</li><li> procedural generation should generate quality content
</li><li> novel interfaces should be responsive and intuitive
</li><li> location-based systems should be practical and playable in real spaces
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Meaningfulness
<ul><li> Is the innovation meaningful in terms of gameplay or experience?
</li><li> Does the game take advantage of the affordances of the innovation (i.e. does it make the innovation a strength)?
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Note that the sophistication of game artwork/audio and the size of the game will NOT be factored as a part of the assessment. 
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Submission">Submission</span></h2>
<p>Please build your game for HTML5 WebGL or Mac .app, and zip up all the required files included assets.
</p><p>You should also hand in your Unity project, zip the complete project directory.
</p><p>Submit both zip files using the C-Bass electronic hand-in system (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://handin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/handin/1617/COMP3218/">https://handin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/handin/1617/COMP3218/</a>) by 4pm on the due date. When submitting please make the name of your game, and the names of the two people in your pair clear in the comments.
</p>
